# Write your First Game in C++
  By: *Abhilekh Gautam*
  
  Are you tired of writing console based programs in C++ and want to use C++ for more fun, then this book is for you. At the end of this book you will have a fully fledged working 2D game for you.To write this game we will use olc::PixelGameEngine and some Modern C++.
  
  For more about olc::PixelGameEngine visit [here](https://github.com/OneLoneCoder/olcPixelGameEngine).

  The entire source code of the game is available [here](https://github.com/Abhilekhgautam/Space-Warrior).
   ## Prerequisites
* A Simple Understanding of C++ would work. You should be aware of Inheritance in C++. We will try to use as much modern C++ as Possible. 


## Setup
Since we will be using olc::PixelGameEngine for this purpose we will need to set it up. This won't be covered in this book as everything about that is available in its official docs.
