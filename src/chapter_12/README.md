# Final Words
C++ is a very challenging language to learn. I always take programming as fun, everybody should enjoy programming. But the problem is most beginner coding projects with C++ won't be interesting, and the interesting ones are too difficult to implement. So, this book aimed to help writing C++ without caring anything about performance and all other issue.

I hope I've helped you moving around with C++.

Hope you had fun.
