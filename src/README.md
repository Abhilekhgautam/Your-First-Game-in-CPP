# Write your First Game in C++
  By Abhilekh Gautam
  
  Are you tired of writing console based programs in C++ and want to use C++ for more fun, then this is for you.

  At the end of this book you will have a fully fledged 2D game for you.

  To write this game we will use OLC Pixel Game Engine and some C++ 17.
  
  For more about olc Pixel Game engine visit: [here](https://github.com/OneLoneCoder/olcPixelGameEngine)

  The entire source code of the game is available at : [https://github.com/Abhilekhgautam/space-warrior](https://github.com/Abhilekhgautam/Space-Warrior)
   ## Prequisites
A Simple Understanding of C++ would work. You should be aware of Inheritance in C++. We will try to use as much modern C++ as Possible. 

   ## Setup
Since we will be using OLC Pixel Game Engine for this purpose we will need to set it up. This won't be covered in book as everything about that is available in its official docs.
