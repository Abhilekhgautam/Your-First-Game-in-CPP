# Introduction
 Welcome to 'Write your First Game in C++'. The main objective of this book is to have some fun with C++. C++ is considered to be difficult and boring by many. The reason to find it boring is many universities (in Nepal) are teaching C++98/03 and are bounding them in writing console based programs which brings the vibe that C++ is useless among many.

 This book is to remind you that C++ is not boring at all. You will see why soon.

 ## Who is this book for?
 This book is intended for everyone who wish to have fun with C++.
