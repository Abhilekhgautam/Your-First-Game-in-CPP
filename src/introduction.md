# Introduction
Welcome to *Write Your First Game in C++*! The goal of this book is to show that programming with C++ can be fun and engaging. Despite its reputation as a difficult language, C++ is a powerful tool that can be used to create a wide variety of programs. Unfortunately, many universities in Nepal teach outdated versions of C++ (such as C++98/03) and primarily focus on console-based programs, which can give the impression that C++ is not useful. This book aims to change that perception and demonstrate the capabilities of C++ by guiding you through the process of creating your own game. It is also an excellent resource for anyone looking to learn C++ and programming in general.

## Who is this book for?
 This book is intended for everyone who wish to have fun with C++.
